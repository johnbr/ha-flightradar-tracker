/**
 * Borrowing Home Assistant's own `<ha-map>` instead of bundling a map library.
 *
 * `ha-map` is the element behind the built-in Map card, so the tiles, the
 * dark-mode handling and the pan/zoom behaviour are the ones the rest of the
 * dashboard already has -- at no cost to this bundle, and with no API key.
 *
 * Facts 1-4 were checked against the running frontend chunk (2026.8,
 * `frontend_latest/52451.*.js`), fact 5 against 2026.10.1 (`49854.*.js`), not
 * taken from documentation.
 *
 * 1. **It is lazily loaded.** On a dashboard with no Map card the tag is an
 *    inert unknown element. The only supported way to pull the chunk in is to
 *    ask the card helpers to build a `map` card and throw it away --
 *    `ensureHaMap()`.
 *
 * 2. **It takes no `hass`.** Since 2026.8 everything it needs (`_states`,
 *    `_config`, `_i18n`, `_formatters`, `_connection`) arrives over Lit context
 *    with `subscribe: true`. Context requests are composed DOM events, so they
 *    cross shadow boundaries and are answered at the app root -- which is why
 *    nothing is threaded through here, and why the element only works inside
 *    the Home Assistant app tree. A Lovelace card always is.
 *
 * 3. **It re-fits itself when `_loaded` flips, and that branch is not gated on
 *    `autoFit`:** `update()` runs `(changed.has("_loaded") || this.autoFit && …)
 *    && this.fitMap()`. With no entities, zones or `layers`, `fitMap()` takes an
 *    early return that centres on the *home* coordinates at zoom 14. So a fit
 *    performed before `_loaded` is true gets silently overwritten by that.
 *    `whenEngineReady()` therefore waits for `_loaded`, not just for an engine.
 *
 * 4. **`disconnectedCallback()` destroys the map** and clears `_loaded`.
 *    Everything drawn on it dies with it, so callers must key their own
 *    markers on the *engine instance* and rebuild when it changes, never on
 *    the element.
 *
 * 5. **Since 2026.10 the element is an engine wrapper.** It holds a pluggable
 *    `_engine` -- MapLibre (vector tiles) by default, Leaflet only when WebGL
 *    is unavailable or after the MapLibre engine dies -- and both engines
 *    implement the same drawing API, which is what the card draws through
 *    (see engine.ts). Facts 3 and 4 hold for both: `_loaded` flips once the
 *    engine is up, and `disconnectedCallback()` calls `_engine.destroy()`. A
 *    WebGL context loss also swaps the engine for a Leaflet one in place, so
 *    the card has to notice `_engine` changing even while it stays connected.
 *
 * 6. **Up to 0.5.x this card forced the Leaflet engine** (`_forceLeaflet`) and
 *    drew raw Leaflet layers. On the Pixel Tablet that flag appeared not to
 *    hold; the real cause was a duplicate Lovelace resource serving an older
 *    build, and both the flag and the `_handleEngineFatal()` fallback it grew
 *    are gone with the port.
