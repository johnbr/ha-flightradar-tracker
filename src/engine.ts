/**
 * `ha-map`'s engine-neutral drawing API, as of Home Assistant 2026.10.
 *
 * Since 2026.10 `ha-map` wraps a pluggable `_engine` -- MapLibre by default,
 * Leaflet when WebGL is missing -- and both engines implement the same small
 * surface: `addMarker` / `addCircle` / `addPath`, each returning a handle. This
 * file types the part of that surface the card uses, and papers over the one
 * place the two engines differ.
 *
 * Everything here was read off the running frontend (2026.10.1:
 * `frontend_latest/41645.*.js` is the MapLibre engine, `8200.*.js` the Leaflet
 * one, `49854.*.js` the `ha-map` element), not from documentation -- the API is
 * internal and undocumented, so re-check these facts first when a Home
 * Assistant release breaks the map.
 *
 * Facts that shape the code:
 *
 * 1. **`addMarker` takes an element WE own.** The engine sizes it and positions
 *    it; restyling is then a matter of rewriting its contents, which -- unlike
 *    Leaflet's `setIcon` -- keeps the node, so nothing blinks and no listener is
 *    lost.
 *
 * 2. **Only the MapLibre handle can move.** Its handle has `setLocation()`. The
 *    Leaflet handle has no such method; it exposes the raw `L.Marker` as
 *    `marker` instead (`ha-map`'s own draggable-marker shim moves one by
 *    removing and re-adding it). `moveMarker()` takes whichever is there. The
 *    Leaflet handle's `location` is a plain field set once, so it goes stale
 *    after a move -- read positions from our own bookkeeping, never from it.
 *
 * 3. **A path is one colour, a fixed 3 px wide, with per-segment opacity.**
 *    There is no weight, no dash and no `bringToFront`. On MapLibre each path
 *    is a pair of GeoJSON sources and layers inserted just below the basemap's
 *    first symbol layer, i.e. above every custom layer added before it -- so
 *    removing and re-adding a path is what raises it.
 *
 * 4. **MapLibre writes each marker's `transform` on every frame the map moves.**
 *    A CSS transition on that property -- the glide trick the 0.5.x Leaflet
 *    build used -- would make every aircraft trail behind the map during a pan.
 *    So motion is driven per animation frame instead (map-layer.ts).
 *
 * 6. **Stacking differs.** On MapLibre our element IS the positioned marker, so
 *    its `z-index` orders it among the others. On Leaflet it sits inside the
 *    engine's icon div and Leaflet orders markers by latitude plus a
 *    `zIndexOffset` (1000 for `raised`); `raiseMarker()` does both.
 *
 * 5. **Zoom levels are normalised.** MapLibre runs one level below Leaflet for
 *    the same scale; `ha-map`'s public `fitBounds` / `setView` / `getView`
 *    convert, so the card should only ever zoom through the element.
